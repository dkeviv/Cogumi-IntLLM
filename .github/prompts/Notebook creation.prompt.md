Create a jupyter notebook that can be followed step by step. Later if a different model is to be used. It should be as simple as just changing that parameter and click run all the cells . Once done everything should be ready and can do demo. In notebook have logic to check if any existing file can be reused instead of keep creating a new. Such files should be common and doesnt have to be changed just for chaning the model. Basically it should be like hotswap.
